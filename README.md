# ECS 171 Project - Group 3
## Front-End
To see the front end model visit the About section in the repo or type in tinyurl.com/171group3 which will lead to a website that is hosted through streamlit with a form that asks a couple of questions.
Here is the demo link "https://youtu.be/0xFOsGqz2eg?si=MrZ2UDme3uRuvlOR" for instructions on how to use the front-end

## About the Project
This repository hosts code used to generate models for ECS171 Winter Quarter. In order to build your own models, you will need the dataset we used (link to UCI link), along with a few python libraries (link).
